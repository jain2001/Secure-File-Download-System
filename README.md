2. **API Call**: Sends the local file path to the Spring Boot API.
3. **File Scanning**: Spring Boot server uploads the file to VirusTotal and waits for the analysis.
4. **Malware Detection**:
   - If the file is **clean**: a success message is shown.
   - If the file is **malicious**: it is deleted from the system immediately.
